title: "Basic i3 Arch Linux Setup"

In this post I document my first basic setup process for any installation. Please note that this is what works for me and can differ depending on hardware.

After I botched my Manjaro i3 installation and some further [readings](https://manjarno.snorlax.sh/), I dove deeper into other Arch-based alternatives. I wanted a pre-configured tiling window manager setup out of the box as I didn't want to spend a lot of time customising and optimising my system.

## Backups

Having a systematic backup approach is always important, especially in the case of Arch not being known to be the most stable distro. Tools I use:

- `timeshift` for system snapshots - using RSYNC it is lightning fast
- `restic` for home directory backups, also using RSYNC.

Next in `~/.config/i3/`, I change a few keybindings such as `hjkl`. Now a few hardware-specific configuations need to be addressed.

## Brightness adjustment script

Adapted from https://gitlab.com/Nmoleo/i3-volume-brightness-indicator to use `brightnessctl` because xbacklight does not work for me.

```shell
# Uses regex to get brightness from brightnessctl
function get_brightness {
    brightnessctl | grep -Po '[0-9]{1,3}%'
}

# In main function:
case $1 in
    brightness up)
    # Increases brightness and displays the notification
    brightnessctl set $brightness_step%+
    show_brightness_notif
    ;;

    brightness_down)
    # Decreases brightness and displays the notification
    brightnessctl set $brightness_step%-
    show_brightness_notif
    ;;
esac
```

Then in i3's config, call the script functions like so:

```shell
bindsym XF86MonBrightnessUp exec --no-startup-id ~/.config/i3/scripts/volume_brightness.sh brightness_up
bindsym XF86MonBrightnessDown exec --no-startup-id ~/.config/i3/scripts/volume_brightness.sh brightness_down
```

## Internal mic mute button

Dependencies: `amixer`.

```shell
bindsym XF86AudioMicMute exec amixer sset Capture toggle
```

## Touchpad configuration

To enable natural scrolling and tapping on X11 start, in `/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/30-touchpad.conf`:

```shell
Section "InputClass"
    Identifier "devname"
    Driver "libinput"
    MatchIsTouchPad "on"
    Option "Tapping" "on"
    Option "Natural Scrolling" "true"
EndSection

```

## Make Firefox scroll smoothly with the touchpad

By default the scrolling experience is not smooth. This command should fix that:

```shell
echo export MOZ_USE_XINPUT2=1 | sudo tee /etc/profile.d/use-xinput2.sh
```

## Missing fonts

Most of the time special fonts will be missing. These are the packages to install to fix that:

```shell
sudo pacman -S noto-fonts noto-fonts-cjk noto-fonts-emoji noto-fonts-extra
```

## Enable TRIM on SSD drive

Optional, helps maintain SSD performance.

```shell
sudo systemctl enable fstrim.timer
sudo systemctl start fstrim.timer
```

## Conclusion

With this I have a basic functioning i3 setup. I find that it's hard to go without a tiling window manager anymore, it just makes my workflow much faster and fluid especially on a laptop without a mouse.

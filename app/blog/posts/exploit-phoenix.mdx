I first took a system and software security assessment at university, introducing me to the intricate world of binary exploitation. From there I have been motivated to explore further into this field. Up to now I have only worked with 32-bit programs, so I decided to work through the 64-bit [Exploit Education Phoenix](https://exploit.education/phoenix/) (formerly Protostar) set of levels for a different challenge. The source code is available in each level's section online.

## Setup

I won't go over installing [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/download/), as OS-specific installation is available on their website. I am working on a Linux machine, your setup process may differ on a different operating system.

For Linux, download the AMD64 Qcow2 QEMU image archive and extract it. Inside there is a boot script, simply `chmod +x` and run it. The VM will start up with SSH open over port 2222. Connect with:

```
$ ssh -p2222 user@localhost
```

Default credentials are `user:user` for user account and `root:root` for root account.

## Tools

I will use my local machine for writing exploits using [pwntools](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools). A nice tutorial covering all the basics is available [here](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools-tutorial). The VM itself comes with [GEF](https://github.com/hugsy/gef), an extension for GDB which makes debugging and exploitation a much more intuiative experience.
